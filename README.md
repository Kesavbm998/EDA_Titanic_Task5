# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my **Data Analyst Internship - Task 5**.  
The objective is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Titanic dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Google Colab** (for execution and visualization)
- **CSV Dataset**: `sample_titanic_dataset.csv`

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files in Repository
- `sample_titanic_dataset.csv` â€“ Dataset used for the analysis.
- `task5_titanic_eda.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the full EDA process.
- 'task5_titanic_eda.ipynb' - Colab.pdf' â€“ PDF export of the notebook with outputs and visualizations.
- `README.md` â€“ Documentation for the project.

## ðŸ“Š EDA Process
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Checked dataset structure, missing values, and basic statistics.
2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Histograms, boxplots, and count plots for single variables.
3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Examined relationships between features such as Survival vs Gender, Age, and Class.
4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Heatmap to visualize numerical correlations.
5. **Key Insights**
   - Extracted important findings from the analysis.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Most survivors were **female**.
- **Pclass 1** had the highest survival rate.
- **Younger passengers** had higher survival chances.
- Higher **fare** is positively correlated with survival.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Create a new notebook and paste the EDA code.
3. Upload `sample_titanic_dataset.csv` to the Colab environment.
4. Run all cells to generate visualizations and insights.
5. Export the notebook as PDF for submission.
